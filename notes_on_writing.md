# Notes on writing

**Working notes on writing, by Michael Nielsen:** These are _rough_
  working notes.  I'm writing them to help me achieve a better quality
  of writing in polished pieces.  They're not intended to be models of
  prose in themselves.

## Titles

**The Future of Ideas (Lessig):** I'm not sure whether this is a good
  title or not.  It's ambitious and provocative, a big-picture title.
  It almost forces the reader to confront the question: what is the
  future of ideas?  But it's huge scope also means that it's a vague
  title.  And, in the end, it's not quite what the book is about.  The
  book is really about the future of expression, i.e., the future of
  how ideas and culture are expressed.  This makes the title somewhat
  elusive, the kind where, after reading the book, you may not recall
  the title.

**The Society of Mind (Minsky):** What I like about this title is that
  it really is exactly what the book is about.  After you've read the
  book you won't have any difficulty recalling the title.  A problem
  with the title is that it's not really obvious to the prospective
  reader what it means.  It does, at least, sound pregnant with
  meaning, and it's also an idea that is relatively easy to explain.
  It might, perhaps, have been helped by a subtitle: "how the mind
  arises through many agents", or something in that vein.  (That's not
  a good subtitle, but something along those lines might have worked.)

## Opening sentences

**Is the sentence striking enough to make the reader want to read
  more?**

**Does the sentence start as late as possible?**

**When in trouble, quickly brainstorm ten or more opening sentences:**
  On occasion, one comes to a piece of writing with the perfect
  opening sentence.  Take the good fortune and run!  
  
  When one does not have that sentence, things become difficult.  It's
  tempting to compromise, and to accept a mediocre opening sentence.
  This is a bad mistake.  The opening sentence is the reader's
  introduction to your writing.  A mediocre opening is statement that
  you're not going to make good use of their time.  It's also a
  turn-off for you as an author, making you less excited about your
  project.  By contrast, a good opening sentence establishes trust
  with the reader, and helps excite you about your own work.
    
  So what to do when you're having trouble finding a good opening
  sentence?
  
  In my opinion: just start brainstorming.  Quickly generate 10 or
  more opening sentences.  Don't worry about whether they're good or
  not.  Instead, try to connect with many different ways of thinking
  about the subject at hand.  Then, once you've got a stock of
  sentences, start to think analytically about the sentences.  What
  makes each one good or bad?  Can you improve any of the sentences?
  Do they suggest more ideas for sentences?
  
  This is a time-intensive process.  It can feel like wasted time --
  you might end up spending an hour (or even more!) on this.  But it's
  not wasted time.  The opening sentence is the beginning of your
  relationship with the reader, and with your own piece of work.  On
  both counts you want things to start off on the right foot.
  
  Many of these comments apply also to the title, subtitle, and to the
  opening paragraph.  Note that a great opening paragraph can, to a
  considerable extent, compensate for a less-than-great opening
  sentence.  Of course, it's better to have both.
    
### Opening sentence: "How Buildings Learn" (Brand)

> Year after year, the cultural elite of San Francisco is treated to
> the sight of its pre-eminent ladies, resplendently gowned, lined up
> in public waiting to pee.

A terrific opening.  The observation is striking, true, interesting,
funny, and, it turns out, a good introduction to the topic at hand.  

I especially like the humorous contrast.  Brand starts with lofty
language: "cultural elite", "resplendently gowned", etc.  But then we
have the crass "waiting to pee".  If you toned down the lofty
language, or toned up the crass language, the sentence would not be
nearly as funny.  Furthermore, while the observation would remain
true, it would be a less interesting truth.

### Opening sentence: "The Selfish Gene" (Dawkins)

> Intelligent life on a planet comes of age when it first works out
> the reason for its own existence

It's a provocative assertion.  Possibly wrong, certainly contentious.
But interesting, in a let's-stay-up-talking-to-3am kind of way, a
kicker of a conversation starter.  The phrase "on a planet" could
arguably be omitted.  It might be better to say something like: "An
intelligent species comes of age when...".

### Opening sentence: "What Technology Wants" (Kelly)

> For most of my life I owned very little.

### Opening sentence: "A Brief History of Time" (Hawking)

> A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave
> a public lecture on astronomy.

This is scene-setting, an introduction to a story.  It has the
advantage that the tone is light.  The "some say it was Bertrand
Russell" even makes the point that it is determinedly light and
informal!

### Opening sentence: "The Language Instinct" (Pinker)

> As you are reading these words, you are taking part in one of the
> wonders of the natural world.

### Opening sentence: "Cosmos" (Sagan)

> In ancient times, in everyday speech and custom, the most mundane
> happenings were connected with the grandest cosmic events.

This sentence describes a striking phenomenon.  But it loses something
because it leaves vague exactly what is being connected to what.

### Opening sentence: "A Planet of Viruses" (Zimmer)

> Fifty miles southeast of the Mexican city of Chihuahua is a dry,
> bare mountain range called Sierra de Naica.
