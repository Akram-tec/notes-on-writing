# Notes on writing

**Working notes on writing, by Michael Nielsen:** Note that these are
  _rough_ working notes.  They're intended to help me achieve a better
  quality of writing in polished pieces, not to be models of prose in
  themselves.

## Opening sentences

**Is the sentence striking enough to make the reader want to read
  more?**

**Does the sentence start as late as possible?**

**Generate ten or more opening sentences:** On occasion, one has the
  perfect opening sentence.  When that's the case, great --- take the
  good fortune and run.  But when not, things become more difficult.
  It's tempting to compromise, and to accept a mediocrate opening
  sentence.  The problem is that this is the reader's introduction to
  the piece.  A mediocre opening is a real turn-off.  Worse, it's a
  turn-off for you as an author, making you less excited about your
  project.  What to do?  In my opinion: just start brainstorming.
  Don't worry about whether the generated sentences are good or not.
  Instead, try to connect with many different ways of thinking about
  the subject at hand.  Then, once you've got a stock of sentences,
  start to think analytically about the sentences.  What makes each
  one good or bad?  Can you improve any of the sentences?  Do they
  suggest more ideas for sentences?

### Opening sentence: "How Buildings Learn" (Brand)

> Year after year, the cultural elite of San Francisco is treated to
> the sight of its pre-eminent ladies, resplendently gowned, lined up
> in public waiting to pee.

A terrific opening.  The observation is striking, true, interesting,
funny, and, it turns out, a good introduction to the topic at hand.  

I especially like the humorous contrast.  Brand starts with lofty
language: "cultural elite", "resplendently gowned", etc.  But then we
have the crass "waiting to pee".  If you toned down the lofty
language, or toned up the crass language, the sentence would not be
nearly as funny.  Furthermore, while the observation would remain
true, it would be a less interesting truth.

### Opening sentence: "What Technology Wants" (Kelly)

> For most of my life I owned very little.

### Opening sentence: "A Brief History of Time" (Hawking)

> A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave
> a public lecture on astronomy.

This is scene-setting, an introduction to a story.  It has the
advantage that the tone is light.  The "some say it was Bertrand
Russell" even makes the point that it is determinedly light and
informal!

### Opening sentence: "The Language Instinct" (Pinker)

> As you are reading these words, you are taking part in one of the
> wonders of the natural world.

### Opening sentence: "Cosmos" (Sagan)

> In ancient times, in everyday speech and custom, the most mundane
> happenings were connected with the grandest cosmic events.

This sentence describes a striking phenomenon.  But it loses something
because it leaves vague exactly what is being connected to what.

### Opening sentence: "A Planet of Viruses" (Zimmer)

> Fifty miles southeast of the Mexican city of Chihuahua is a dry,
> bare mountain range called Sierra de Naica.
